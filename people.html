                      As the Internet grew in size and accessibility, younger people in the industry realized that community was the key to cultivating success in the new digital age. While previously media was held by a few large distribution monopolies, the Internet provided a platform that democratized access and where the masses decided success or failure. The first industry to feel their foundation shake was the music industry. After the development of the .mp3 file and players, users were now able to download music directly from the internet. However, most of these collections were decentralized and privately hosted. Sean Fanning and Napster developed the first peer to peer website where users can search millions of music collections and trade their files. After exploding in popularity, the recording industry saw its death coming, and tried it hardest to stop it. They successfully sued and shut down Napster, but it was too late. The potential of the Internet had been fully realized, piracy still ran rampant, and record sales consistently dropped. Eventually sites like Myspace, Facebook, YouTube, and more brought a revolution in terms of community, video, and news. The young programmers in the know saw the power of the people coming, and harnessed it much faster than older corporations slowed by bureaucracy and blinded by experience.
