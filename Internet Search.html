<p style="font-size:30px">Google is an example of a search engine that allows one to search for information and retrieve it from different sources. Finding what you wanted from the web was really difficult and cumbersome before the creation of the search engine. Jerry Yang and David Filo founded Yahoo! and managed to create the first most popular search engine known as Yahoo! Search.  In 1994 they created a web directory called Yahoo! Directory which allowed people to search for anything that was in the directory. People could search for web pages or anything that interested them. Not long after, many search engines had been created and gained some popularity. These included:<li> Magellan</li>
<p style="font-size:30px"><li>AltaVista</li>
<p style="font-size:30px"><li>Northern Light</li>
<p style="font-size:30px"><li>Inktomi</li>
<p style="font-size:30px"><li>& more</li>
<p style="font-size:30px">Google began gaining popularity in 2000. An obstacle that Google faced was how to receive funding. To solve this, Bill Gross came up with a solution that involved using relevance links and ads to generate income. He realized that when people typed something into the search engine, they would also sometimes be interested in buying something related to it. He realized the potential that Google had to be the worldâ€™s most powerful marketing research tool because of keywords. Due to these innovations, Google has been as successful as it is since.
