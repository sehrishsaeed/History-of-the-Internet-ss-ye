                      In the early 1990’s, computing hardware and internet access was beginning to be democratized.A combination of Moore’s Law and Metcalfe’s law, which defined exponential growth for manufacturing of computing hardware and growth of computer networks, predicted a meteoric rise in the already immensely popular technologies. As more and more companies saw value in these emerging technologies, Wall Street funds and venture capitalists began heavily investing in these startups and emerging technologies. The rise of Amazon and its central tenet of Get Big Fast inspired a host of other companies that believed they can replicate that success. And with the rise of day traders throwing their money into the mix, it was easy for any company with a dot com name and a business plan to get thousands of dollars. While most people did not expect all these companies to survive, no one wanted to be left behind while profits were being made. After a holiday season that was forecast to bring record profits showed disappointing returns, the bubble finally popped. Companies went bankrupt overnight, and even large players like Intel and Oracle were hurt financially. Eventually, the surviving companies used the infrastructure built in that time to cement themselves as titans in the field.
