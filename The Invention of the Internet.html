                             The invention of the internet can be considered on par with
    the invention of the wheel or fire.It’s profound effect on society
    and contribution to globalization is something never been seen before.
    J. C. R. Licklider who was an American psychologist ultimately envisioned
    the internet as being a communication tool between people that would connect
    through computers. The first computers were very large and not meant
    to be communicative. The Sputnik scare in 1957 launched the first man-made
    satellite into space. This startled America and thus began the interest
    in more science and technology related ideas. In 1965 an MIT scientist
    proposed a way to send data through “packet switching”. It essentially
    breaks down data into blocks before sending it where it needs to go.
    This also helped in measuring network speeds. By 1970 many more computers
    began to be connected to the ARPAnet. In 1991 the internet took a different
    route and became a place where people could store information, and anyone could
    retrieve it. TThis was known as the World Wide Web. Since then, there have been
    many technological advances since the origins of the internet including different
    browser types.
